This bot was written to be used in remote roleplay game called After Dark. One interesting moment is that it works in two chats in parallel. There is a group channel where bot reads users messages and calculates number of smiles and a personal chat for every player, where bot sends message when user send too many smiles.

# This repository is created as an example of Telegram bot application for people who want to learn how to write one.
